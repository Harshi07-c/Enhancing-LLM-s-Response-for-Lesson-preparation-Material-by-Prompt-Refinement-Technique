To run the frontend on your pc :

1)Extract the contents of the build zip file.

2)Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted build folder.

3)Start a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in HTTP server. You can do this by running the following command: python -m http.server 8000 .This command will start a simple HTTP server on port 8000.

4)Once the server is running, you can open a web browser and enter http://localhost:8000 to access the frontend.
