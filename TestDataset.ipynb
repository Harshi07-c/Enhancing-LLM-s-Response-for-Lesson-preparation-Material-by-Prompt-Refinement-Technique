        "      Arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or multi-dimensional. In a one-dimensional array, elements are stored in a linear sequence. In a two-dimensional array, elements are arranged in rows and columns. Multi-dimensional arrays extend this concept to more than two dimensions.\n",

The time complexity for accessing and modifying elements in an array is O(1) since it takes constant time to access any element by its index.\n",
